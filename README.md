# Kalmia

## Callin Switzer
## Experiments conducted summer 2016


Code from a variety of languages (R, Python, Matlab) that was used to process and visualize the data collected for a variety of my projects involving Kalmia latifolia (the mountain laurel)

* Image segmentation and processing of high-speed videos to visualize pollen
* 4D visualization (3 Dimensional heat map) of pollen 'hot zones'
* Image segmentation of photos of Kalmia fruits to measure size and count the number
* Multilevel models in R to test significance of a number of pollination treatments
